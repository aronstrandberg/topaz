# topaz
Website for [@datasektionen](http://github.com/datasektionen)'s 35 year anniversary

The name is a reference to using the precious metals and gemstones as nicknames for anniveraries – silver is 25, ruby is 40. 35 years doesn't have an established name, so we made one up. Topaz apparently being more affordable than ruby gems, it made sense.
